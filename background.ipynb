    "Spike trains are key to how neurons encode and transmit information. However, even when the same stimulus is presented to different neurons, the spiking behavior can vary dramatically.\n",

    "Traditional approaches for modeling neuronal spiking involve biophysical simulations like the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which require detailed ion channel kinetics and are computationally intensive. In contrast, machine learning can abstract away from those low-level details and attempt to capture spiking patterns directly from observed data.\n",
